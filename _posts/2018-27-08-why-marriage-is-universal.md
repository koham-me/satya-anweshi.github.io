## What is marriage?
Marriage is a custom of uniting two individuals, which in general have a wedding ceremoany and/or marriage certificates for its approval by the society and law. However there have been varying definitions propsed by anthropologists, to aggregate wide variety of marital practices performed across different societies in the world.

In "The History of Human Marriage" Westermarck defined marriage as "a more or less durable connection between male and female lasting beyond mere act of propogation till after the birth of the offspring." However in "The Future of Marriage in Wedstern Civilization", he rejected his definition and defined it as "a relation of one or more men to one or more women that is recognized by law and customs."

As per Murdock in "Social Structures" marriage is complex of systems centering upon relationship between sexually associating pair of adults within the family. Marriage defines the manner of establishing and termination such relationship, the normative behaviour and the reciprocal obligations within it, and locally accepted restrictions upon its personnel.

Duran Bell descrbes marriage as "a relationship between one or more men(male or female) in sevarlty to one or more woman that provides those men with a demand right of sexual access within domestic group and identifies woman who bear the obligation of yielding to the demands of those specific men."

I find what Ember and Ember has discussed in "Anthropology" book more relevant. Marriage is a socially approved sexual and economic union between a man and woman. It is presumed, by both the couple and others to be more or less permanent and it subsumes reciprocal rights and obligations bewteen the two spouses and between spouses and their future children.

## Why is marriage universal?
Almost, every society in the world has practice of male-female marraige. This is a custom which is practised throughout the world. Societies grew out from different regions, civilizations, religions, races distant from each other without any communications among them. But the custom of marriage exists in all of them. Several ways people have tried to explain why all human societies have custom of marriage. According to Ember and Ember, each of these explaination suggests that *marriage solved problem found in all socitities.*

## Problems found in all societies.

### Gender division of labour.
All socities in the world assign or divide labour differently to males and females. The intersting point to make here is that every society does not have different work for females and males but they divide up work in similar way. Below table shows worldiwde pattern in the divison of labour by gender.

|	| Males Almost Always | Males Usually | Either gender or both | Females Usually | Females Always 
Primary subsistence activites | Hunt and trap animals | Fish, Herd Large animals, Collect wild honey Clear Land and prepare soil for planting | Collect Sellfish, Care for small animals, Plant crops, Tend crops, Harvest crops, Milk animals | Gather wild plants |
Secondary subsistnce activites | | Butcher animals | Preserve meat or fish | Care for children, Cook and prepare vegetable foods, drinks, dairy products, Launder, fetch water and collect fuel.|
Other | Lumber mine and quarry, make boats, musical instruments, bone horn or shell objects | Build houses, Make nets, rope | Prepare skins, make leather products, baskets, mats, clothing, pottery | Spin yarn |

There have been much of studies on why there is difference in labour division by gender, this is not primary aim of this writeup. The point here is that all socities have similar rule of dividing labour by geneder. The result of product of the labour has to be shared for survival of the society. And to share it, society has to have some mechanism. One solution to this is marriage, which solves the problem of sharing. Howvere we can not say this is the only solution. A group of men and women(such as brother and sisters) can agree to share their product of labour and may cooperate economically. 

### Prolonged Infant Dependency
In most of the societies mother is main child tender. Humans have longest infant dependency among all primates. This prolonged dependency places burden on mother, which limits the knid of work she can perform. This results into her to have help from some male to do certain kind of work, such as hunting etc which are incompatible with child care. But why would one help her? The solution is marriage. But again, is marriage only solution to this problem? Group of men and women again can gather and agree to cooperate, or group of females can agree to cooperate during the child care. So marriage is solution, but not the only solution to this problem.

### Sexual Competetion
Some scholars have suggested that female sexuality may have created problem in of sexual competetion among males. Unlike other primates human female may engage in intercourse at any time throughout the year. More or less continuous female sexulaity may have created the problem of sexual competetion among male. Society has to prevent this competetion for survival and reproduction. It has to develop mechanism to reduce the competetion which may result in destruction of the society as whole. Again marriage is one solution to this problem. But this argument also has its weekness. This competetion could have been regularized by cultural rules. One may argue that group of men and women may have been circultaed among themeselves, such that each person staying for specified length of period with each partner. In many animals, many primates close to human, that have relatively frequent female sexulaity, males do not show much aggression over females. Hence this argument is also not very strong in favour of marriage as solution.

### Postpartum Requirements
Ember and Ember perfomed study on more than fourty mammal and bird species, none of the three factors above mentioned, predicts or correlates strongly with male-female bonding. Mammals and birds that have longer dependency period or greater female sexuality are less likely to have stable matings. One thing they found interesting is that animal species in which females can feed themeselves and their infants in postpartum period (Birth to 6 weeks) tend not to have stable mating, however for the species females not able to feed during postpartum period to themselves and infants have stable mating. They believe that this is the reason of the marraige in human. In support of their claim they argue that if mother took turns babysitting with other female, neither might be able to collect food enough for both two mothers and two sets of children dependent on them. But a mother and father share same set of children and hence it would be easier to feed themselves and children. Another argument is based on no pair bonding. Lets assume that there is no couple and only group of promiscous group of males and females. They argue in this kind of arrangement a mother can not count on some male to watch her baby while she goes out for food, or bring her food while she had to watch her baby. But this reasearch is based on other animals, which may or may not be applicable to human.

This is still an open ended question and anthropologists across world are working to find answer.
