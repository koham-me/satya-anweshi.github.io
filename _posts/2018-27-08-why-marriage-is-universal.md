### Note : This is based on anthropological study, do not judge on morality.

## What is marriage?
Marriage is a custom of uniting two individuals, which in general have a wedding ceremoany and or marriage certificates for its approval by the society and law. However there have been varying definitions propsed by anthropologists, to aggregate wide variety of marital practices performed across different societies in the world.

In "The History of Human Marriage" Westermarck defined marriage as "a more or less durable connection between male and female lasting beyond mere act of propogation till after the birth of the offspring." However in "The Future of Marriage in Wedstern Civilization", he rejected his definition and defined it as "a relation of one or more men to one or more women that is recognized by law and customs."

As per Murdock in "Social Structures" marriage is complex of systems centering upon relationship between sexually associating pair of adults within the family. Marriage defines the manner of establishing and termination such relationship, the normative behaviour and the reciprocal obligations within it, and locally accepted restrictions upon its personnel.

Duran Bell descrbes marriage as "a relationship beteen one or more men(male or female) in sevarlty to one or more woman that provides those men with a demand right of sexual access within domestic group and identifies woman who bear the obligation of yielding to the demands of those specific men."

I find what Ember and Ember has discussed in "Anthropology" book more relevant. Marriage is a socially approved sexual and economic union between a man and woman. It is presumed, by both the couple and others to be more or less permanent and it subsumes reciprocal rights and obligations bewteen the two spouses and between spouses and their future children.

## Why is marriage universal?
Almost, every society in the world has practice of male-female marraige. This is a custom which is practised throughout the world. Societies grew out from different regions, civilizations, religions, races distant from each other without any communications among them. But the custom of marriage exists in all of them. Several ways people have tried to explain why all human societies have custom of marriage. According to Ember and Ember, each of these explaination suggests that *marriage solved problem found in all socitities.*

## Problems found in all societies.

### Gender division of labour.
All socities in the world assign or divide labour differently to males and females. The intersting point to make here is that every society does not have different work for females and males but they divide up work in similar way. Below table shows worldiwde pattern in the divison of labour by gender.
