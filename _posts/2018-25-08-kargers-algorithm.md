##Graph
A set of vertices V along with set of edges E connecting these vertices in is called graph and denoted as G(V,E). Example include a social network where each individual can be considered as vertex and any kind of relationship between two individuals can be considered as an edge. Another example is road network connecting different cities. Graph can be undirected where direction of an edge does not matter, it can be directed, when edge have direction.
